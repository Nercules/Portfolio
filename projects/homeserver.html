            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
              Since I love tinkering around with hardware, I decided that
              setting up a homelab server would be a great idea. With this
              server, I could easily store vacation pictures on a file server,
              spin up VMs on demand, set up an ad blocker on my network, and
              maybe even create a cloud gaming server. In addition, I needed to
              ensure that all of this was accessible remotely. After researching
              and gathering the necessary hardware, I decided to use Proxmox, a
              virtualization software, as the backbone of my homelab server.
            </p>

            <h4 class="top_45">Proxmox Virtualization</h4>
            <p>
              To achieve my goals, I chose to use Proxmox, a powerful
              virtualization software that allowed me to create and manage
              multiple virtual machines on my server. Proxmox supports various
              virtualization technologies, including KVM and LXC, making it
              highly versatile and easy to use. With Proxmox, I was able to
              create separate VMs for each of my needs, ensuring that they would
              not interfere with one another.
            </p>

            <h4 class="top_45">Storage and Hardware</h4>
            <p>
              To support my virtualization needs, I chose a second-hand desktop
              with an i7 7700 processor and 16GB of DDR4 memory. The desktop
              came with a 64GB SSD for the OS and a 512GB SSD for VM storage. I
              also added 2x1TB and 2x2TB HDDs in RAID 1 for file storage. This
              hardware configuration allowed me to run multiple VMs
              simultaneously without any performance issues.
            </p>
            <div class="col-md-12 portfolio-images">
              <figure class="bottom_30">
                <img src="../images/hardware.png" alt="" />
              </figure>
            </div>

            <h4 class="top_45">Fileserver</h4>
            <p>
              One of the main reasons I set up a homelab server was to create a
              fileserver for storing files ranging from vacation pictures to old
              schoolwork and personal projects. This allowed me to keep recent
              working data on my laptop without running out of space because of
              older projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              To manage this data, I chose the TurnKey fileserver system. The
              main reason for this choice was the limited resources it uses, but
              if it needs more computing power, it has access to the OS
              resources. Whenever I upload or download a large dataset,
              everything scales on demand. This setup allowed me to access and
              manage my files easily, with the added benefit of not relying on
              third-party cloud services.
            </p>
            <div class="col-md-12 portfolio-images">
              <figure class="bottom_30">
                <img src="../images/turnkey.png" alt="" />
              </figure>
            </div>

            <h4 class="top_45">Add Blocker</h4>
            <p>
              I also wanted to set up an ad blocker on my network, and I chose
              Pi-Hole for this task. Pi-Hole is a well-known and easy-to-use ad
              blocker that doesn't utilize a lot of computing power. It runs in
              a container and is available on my network at home. To use the
              blocker, the user has to manually set a DNS server on their device
              when connected to my network. This way, the user still has the
              choice to not use the ad blocker if it happens to block content
              they want to access.
            </p>

            <h4 class="top_45">Remote Access</h4>
            <p>
              I use Tailscale to remotely access my network and everything on
              it. Tailscale is a VPN service that makes it easy to securely
              connect to my network from anywhere, as long as I have an internet
              connection. With Tailscale, I can manage everything on my network
              from anywhere in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the things I've done with Tailscale is set up an exit node
              on my homeserver. This means that when I'm on a public WiFi
              network, all of my traffic gets encrypted and redirected to my
              homeserver. From there, I access the internet via the exit node,
              which makes it much more secure.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also use Tailscale to access a self-made KVM (a Raspberry Pi
              with jump wires and a camera) that I've set up on my homeserver.
              This allows me to troubleshoot the homeserver remotely if needed.
              There's a camera pointing at the server, and it live streams
              footage to a webpage where I can check the physical state of the
              server. There are also jump wires running from the Raspberry Pi to
              some leds, which can change the value of a photoresistor, that is
              connected to the motherboard of the homeserver, so I can reboot
              and reset the server remotely if necessary (that way I don't mix
              up different electrical circuits).
            </p>
            <div class="col-md-12 portfolio-images">
              <figure class="bottom_30">
                <img src="../images/homeserver-camera.png" alt="" />
              </figure>
            </div>

            <h4 class="top_45">Keep Everything Organized</h4>
            <p>
              With so many different software packages running on my server, it
              can be difficult to keep track of everything. To help me stay
              organized, I use Heimdall, a simple web application that redirects
              me to the web interfaces of each software.
            </p>
            <p>
              This allows me to easily access all of my different tools and
              services from one central location. Heimdall provides a clean,
              organized dashboard that makes it easy to navigate between
              different applications and services.
            </p>
            <p>
              By using Heimdall to keep everything organized, I'm able to spend
              less time hunting for the software I need and more time actually
              using it.
            </p>
            <div class="col-md-12 portfolio-images">
              <figure class="bottom_30">
                <img src="../images/heimdall.png" alt="" />
              </figure>
            </div>

            <h4 class="top_45">Dorm Surveillance</h4>
            <p>
              To ensure the safety of my dorm room while I'm away, I have set up
              a surveillance system using a Raspberry Pi, a Picamera, and
              various software tools. I am currently on an internship in Israel
              and, although I can lock my dorm room, I still wanted an extra
              layer of protection.
            </p>
            <p>
              To achieve this, I have installed Raspberry Pi OS, MotionEye, and
              ZoneMinder. The Raspberry Pi captures the video stream and
              broadcasts it over Tailscale, which is a secure network connection
              that I can access remotely. The video stream is then captured by
              ZoneMinder, which is a video surveillance system that records
              footage only when motion is detected.
            </p>
            <p>
              This setup allows me to keep an eye on my dorm room at all times
              and provides me with peace of mind knowing that I have an extra
              layer of protection.
            </p>
            <div class="col-md-12 portfolio-images">
              <figure class="bottom_30">
                <img src="../images/picam.jpg" alt="" />
              </figure>
            </div>

            <h4 class="top_45">Next Up</h4>
            <p>
              While I'm very happy with my current setup, there are a few things
              I'd like to add or upgrade in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              One thing I'd like to do is install an AMD RX580 8GB graphics card
              in the server. This would allow me to potentially set up a cloud
              gaming system, as well as do some accelerated encoding or GPU
              programming.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm also looking to purchase a proper KVM. While my current
              Raspberry Pi solution works, there are certainly better options
              out there that would provide better performance and reliability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, I'm considering some hardware upgrades, such as
              adding more RAM or upgrading to a newer CPU. With my current
              setup, I'm limited to four physical cores and can't install
              Windows 11, so an upgrade might be necessary in the near future.
            </p>
